# The 11 foot 8 inch bridge

	This is a railroad bridge in Durham, North Carolina which is was only 11 feet and 8 inches tall until October of 2019 at which point the North Carolina Railroad Company who own the bridge raised the bridge another 8 inches to 12 feet and 4 inches.

	The bridge found fame when a nearby office worker set up cameras to film all of the trucks, buses and RVs which collide with it, despite the numerous warning signs. He then posted these videos of over 145 collisions onto social media which then went viral.
